# JSON reports

JSON reports can be enabled using the `json.enabled` property. The preprocessor uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), which means you can place configuration options in EG. `.cypress-cucumber-preprocessorrc.json` or `package.json`. An example configuration is shown below.

```json
{
  "json": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

This **requires** you to have registered this module in your [plugin file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Plugins-file), as shown below.

```ts
import { addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin } from "@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

export default async (
  on: Cypress.PluginEvents,
  config: Cypress.PluginConfigOptions
): Promise<Cypress.PluginConfigOptions> => {
  await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config);

  // Make sure to return the config object as it might have been modified by the plugin.
  return config;
}
```

This also **requires** you to have downloaded and installed the [cucumber-json-formatter](https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/json-formatter) **yourself**. Arch Linux users can install it from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cucumber-json-formatter).

The location of the executable is configurable through the `json.formatter` property, but it will by default search for `cucumber-json-formatter` in your `PATH`.

The report is outputted to `cucumber-report.json` in the project directory, but can be configured through the `json.output` property.

## Attachments

Text, images and other data can be added to the output of the messages and JSON reports with attachments.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach("foobar");
});
```

By default, text is saved with a MIME type of text/plain. You can also specify a different MIME type.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach('{ "name": "foobar" }', "application/json");
});
```

Images and other binary data can be attached using a ArrayBuffer. The data will be base64 encoded in the output.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach(new TextEncoder().encode("foobar").buffer, "text/plain");
});
```

If you've already got a base64-encoded string, you can prefix your mime type with `base64:` to indicate this.

```ts
import { Given, attach } from "@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

Given("a step", function() {
  attach("Zm9vYmFy", "base64:text/plain");
});
```
