Feature: step definitions

  Rule: it should by default look for step definitions in a couple of locations

    Example: step definitions with same filename
      Given a file named "cypress/integration/a.feature" with:
        """
        Feature: a feature name
          Scenario: a scenario name
            Given a step
        """
      And a file named "cypress/integration/a.js" with:
        """
        const { Given } = require("@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");
        Given("a step", function() {});
        """
      When I run cypress
      Then it passes

    Example: step definitions in a directory with same name
      Given a file named "cypress/integration/a.feature" with:
        """
        Feature: a feature name
          Scenario: a scenario name
            Given a step
        """
      And a file named "cypress/integration/a/steps.js" with:
        """
        const { Given } = require("@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");
        Given("a step", function() {});
        """
      When I run cypress
      Then it passes

    Example: step definitions in a common directory
      Given a file named "cypress/integration/a.feature" with:
        """
        Feature: a feature name
          Scenario: a scenario name
            Given a step
        """
      And a file named "cypress/support/step_definitions/steps.js" with:
        """
        const { Given } = require("@klaveness/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");
        Given("a step", function() {});
        """
      When I run cypress
      Then it passes
